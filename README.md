# covid_model

This will be an exploration of what truly places someone at high risk for contracting and dying from covid-19. The news and media reports are quite repetitive with their varables, making their recommendations broad and barely applicable. I hope to create a model that is simple but effective, and can include lifestyle factors as well.
The preliminary goal of this project is to choose relevant variables and produce a classification model for "high risk" or "low risk" for covid-19.
The second goal of this project is to produce an interactable page where one can input their own values for chosen life-related variables and determine if they themselves are high or low risk.
